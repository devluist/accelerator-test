### Assessment A

First part: Create an endpoint
Create a REST paginated endpoint that returns 5000 auto-generated calendar events per user.

Second part: Consumer endpoint
Use that endpoint to consume the events and store them in the database. Your application needs to call this endpoint for 5 unique users every hour and then process all the events in the background. Your application needs to check if an event was deleted (no longer returned by the endpoint), added, or updated. The application should not store duplicated events.

Third part: bonus
Create a GraphQL endpoint that returns the events by the user's email.




### Assessment B

Develop a Node.Js api that allows a client app to:

Obtain the full directory listing of a given directory path on the local filesystem. Include the full path, file size and attribute information in the result and cater for a large directory size ( at least 100 000). You can use REST or Graphql. We are a Graphql company, but if you donâ€™t know it yet then I would suggest you use what you know best.

BONUS: Package this application into a monorepo.
BONUS: Containerized the application.

Once you have completed the project please commit the project to a GitHub repository and input the link here

You can use create react app and other library to make the task more useful.




### Assessment C

Show us some code you have already written that demonstrates your abilities. Obviously, a simple website does not show us much. So if you choose this option make sure you pick something that was somewhat hard and that can be analyzed by us in a reasonable amount of time.

Make sure we can access the repo you share below and you have the copyright of what you are sharing.

Please note that selecting this option does not penalize you if it demonstrates your ability to the the same extent as the above 2 assessments.
